# Junglenational

Hone your jungling skills in this enthralling new 1v1 custom game! 

Junglenational lets each choose 1 of three heroes (single draft style) with which you can duke it out against eachother. 
Lane creeps spawn after 8 minutes, so you only have two choices: 
get as much gold and levels out of the jungle or go kill the enemy in his own jungle. 
The first one to die twice or lose his tower, loses the game...

Warning! This custom game contains 5 spectator slots!
